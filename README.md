## Artist Statement
 * Welcome to 'Think - Demo'. 'Think' is an interactive, decisions-based web-novel. Play in the POV of the main character in her newly adult life, trying to navigate the regular hardships of growing up, such as college studies, friends, identity... and something much more sinister.
 * Every choice you make to help the MC (Main Character) leads to a new path, and see how the different emotions from each of these choices influence those around you.
 * 'Think - Demo' shows the basics of the game's functionality, introduces you to two of the main characters that MC interacts with, and allows you to experience an snippet of the final atmosphere of 'Think'.
 * Click to cycle through dialogue, choose what MC is thinking from the 'brain' menu in the upper right, and watch as the MCs emotions in the left change and characters react.
 Our goals was to create an atmospheric, compelling narrative by mixing the interactivity of JavaScript with traditional stroytelling techniques.
 Note: After the in class demo, we fixed the centering of the text in the brain menu, which used to overflow.
